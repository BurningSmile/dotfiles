# Dotfiles
My Linux system configuration

Mainly used for setting up Devolopment vm's and quickly getting my personal systems up and running.

Things you will need to change to implemet under your system include the following

```
Change any instances of [David] to your account username in all of the files where it is referenced.
In polybar comment out the monitor variable
In Mpd change audio device to your device.
In Mpd Change the user and group to your user and your group to avoid permission errors.You may also want to change the cava framerate.
```

# To use the install script

Read through the scripts in the scripts repo to see what the script does before running it.

The install script is for Arch based systems. An Ubuntu install script will be written when I get the time to sort out the termite install issue.
