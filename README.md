# Dotfiles
My Linux system configuration

Mainly used for setting up Development vm's and quickly getting my personal systems up and running.

Things you will need to change to implement under your system include the following

```
Change any instances of [David] to your account username in all of the files where it is referenced.
In polybar comment out the monitor variable
In polybar change the wlan and eth interfaces to your network interfaces.
In Mpd change audio device to your device.
In Mpd Change the user and group to your user and your group to avoid permission errors.
You may also want to change the cava framerate.
```
