# dotfiles
My Linux system configuration

# To use the install script
git clone https://github.com/BurningSmile/LinuxConfigs.git

cd LinuxConfigs

chmod +x installconfig.sh

./installconfig.sh 

The install script is for Arch based systems. An Ubuntu install script will be writen when I get the time.
